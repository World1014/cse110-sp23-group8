# Fortune Telling With Panda Express

## Overview

Introducing **Fortune Telling with Panda Express**, a website designed to help computer science students improve their communcation skills through an interactice expereince. Our platform will provide users with a good or bad fortune cookie depending on how well they mcok order at Panda Express. This lighthearted approach encourages users (average software engineers) to step out of their comfort zones and talk to someone.

## Problem

Many computer science students struggle with communciation and social skills. It is not uncommon form them to blurt out uncanny responses in day to day coversations. We've identified the need for an engaging way to help these students and give a fortune on their future outlooks.

## Appetite

We are aiming for a 5-week devopment cylce to build the website. We will be using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build the website.
