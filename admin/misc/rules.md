Be respectful and kind to everyone on the team. 

Refrain from being arrogant or dismissive of your teammates

If a TA or team lead asks you to stop something, you should stop.

No obnoxious or disrespectful behavior. This means monitoring your language in discussions with other group members and engaging with others empathetically.

Please choose and retain an appropriate username on GitHub and Slack. Always post appropriate content in Slack.

Please avoid unsuitable or controversial topics while working with the group.

This contract is meant to ensure the success of our group in all of the collaborative work we perform together, for the extent of our enrollment in this course.

As a member of Great Team 8, you are expected to abide by the standards of the group. This includes following the rules laid out above. 

Additionally, each member is compelled to follow these standards for the duration of their membership in Team 8. This list is by no means exhaustive, and team members are generally expected to comport with the expectations typical of UCSD students:

1. Communication: We will communicate regularly and effectively with each other, 
                  both in person and online. We will respond to Slack messages in a timely manner and communicate any concerns or issues to the group in a respectful and professional manner.
2. Attendance: We will attend each meeting to the best of our ability, absent 
               accommodations. In the case of an absence, we will notify the group and provide any necessary updates or contributions remotely.
3. Respect: We will treat each other with respect and professionalism at all 
            times, and we will not communicate in any manner that may be considered discriminatory, disrespectful, or offensive.
4. Conflict Management: We will work together to resolve any conflicts or 
                        disagreements that may arise during the project, in a respectful and professional manner. We will seek input and feedback from all members of the group, and strive to find a solution that benefits the entire group.
5. Collaboration and Decision-Making: Each person will provide their full 
                                      undivided effort, as well as actively participate in group discussions and decision-making processes. If they are unable to participate in-person, they will do so via Slack or Zoom. We will work together to ensure that all group members have the opportunity to contribute significantly to the project.
6. Deadlines: We will adhere to all project deadlines and work together to ensure 
              that all project milestones are met. We will inform the group in advance if we are unable to meet a deadline, and we will work together to find a solution. It goes without saying that each deadline is implemented to safeguard the grade of each team member, so self-imposed deadlines must be taken seriously to this end.
              
As a signatory, you acknowledge and will uphold all of the standards outlined above:
