## Decisions Made

1. **Decision:** The video will show each member striking a ball on a pool table. It will be as if the game progresses from person to person, with the last clip being someone striking the 8-ball into a pocket.
   - **Reasoning:** We are Team 8, and the 8-ball is a key part of the game of pool.
   - **Dissenting Options:** Create a video with millennial memes that would appeal to Professor Powell.
   - **Group's Rationale:** We thought that it might be a bit difficult to match Professor Powell's sense of humor and that it would be easier and more clever to create a video related to the game of pool.
